## Installation

This project built using Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. I highly recommend having a basic knowledge of these technologies to start working with the provided code. 

After locally cloning the code proceed with the following steps:

1. Install dependencies
```sh
npm ci
```
2. Run local serve
```sh
npm run serve
```
3. Build for production
```sh
npm run build
```

Building a production build will provide optimized resources alongside pre-rendering the website for optimal SEO. Using Vue in this project was for interactivity and code decoupling.
